# Legacybot
This is a Discordbot for helping out with "play by post" games of [Legacy: Life Among the Ruins](https://ufopress.co.uk/our-games/legacy-life-among-ruins/). 

## Installation
Past [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=619678791626915850&permissions=8&scope=bot) into your browser and select the server you'd like the bot to join.

## Commands
All commands to Legacybot begin with a forward slash "/".  Legacybot supports the following commands:

### Completed Commands 
| Command        | Args           | Example  | Notes |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|:----------:|
| /new-family     | family name | /new-family "Cultivator of the New Flesh" name="Duhnah"  | This will create a new family. If a family already exists with this name, nothing will happen (all family names must be unique).  By creating a new family, that family is not assigned to the Discord user unless the user adds the family. The playbook must be one of the core Legacy family classes; see ["Supported Family Playbooks"](#supported-family-playbooks) section below. | 
 /set-family      | family name      |   /set-family "Duhnah" | Associates a user with the named family. This won't delete the family. |

### Commands To Develop
| Command        | Args           | Example  | Notes |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|:----------:|
| /drop-family      | family name      |   /drop-family "Duhnah" | Disassociates a user with the named family. This won't delete the family. |
| /delete-family | family name | /delete-family "Duhnah" | Deletes the named family. Legacybot will ask you if you are sure about this. Only the Discord user associated with a family can run this command.
| /new-character     | character class=class name, name=character name | /new-character class="The Reaver" name="Max"  | This will create a new character. If a family already exists with this name, nothing will happen (all family names must be unique).  By creating a new family, that family is assigned to the Discord user unless the user dumps the family. The class must be one of the core Legacy family classes; see the ["Supported Classes"](#supported-classes) section below. | |
|/add-character      | character name      |   /add-character "Max" | Associates a user with the named character.  |
 /drop-character      |  character name     |   /dump-character "Max" | Disassociates a user with the named character. This won't delete the character. |
| /delete-character | character name | /delete-character "Max" | Deletes the named character. Legacybot will ask you if you are sure about this? Only the Discord user associated with a character can run this command.
| /stat| stat-name stat-value      |    /stat reach 1 | Sets the named stat. If the stat is "reach", "grasp", or "sleight", the stat will be set for the family associated with the user. If the stat is "force", "lore", "steel", or "sway", it will be  set for the character associated with the user.|
| /roll|  --a --d  --b=<int>  |  /roll --a --b=1 |  Rolls the dice for your assumed Family or Character, taking into account all their bonuses. `/r --a --b=1` will roll with advantage and +1 modifier. `/r --d` will roll with disadvantage. |

## Development
First clone this Github repo locally.

### Configuration

Third, make a note of the your `token` and `owner id`. These can be configured into the app in two ways:

2) By setting the environment variables `LEGACY_BOT_TOKEN` and `LEGACY_BOT_OWNER_ID`. These will override the values
