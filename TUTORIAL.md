# LegacyBot Tutorial 

This document teaches you how to use Legacybot! 

## Getting Started 

LegacyBot's help system is built into the tool. All LegacyBot commands start with a `.` (period). The first command to remember is the help command. Run it by typing in `.help` or `.h` (all LegacyBots come with a shorthand "alias" or faster typing).

You can learn about what commands are available by typing in `.help -c`, or `.h -c`.

That's a lot of commands! Fortunately, each command comes with its own built-in help with examples. 

## Starting a Family 

The `.family` is how you check your and other player's families, but before you do that you have to create a family first. Run the `.new-family --help` command first.

Let's  create a family using the suggested example by running the command `.nf p=tyrants n="The Citadel"`

And you should see something like this -- ah, LegacyBot, babbling in the native tongue of long-dead programmers!
